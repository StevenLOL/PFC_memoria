\section{HMM-Based Speech Synthesis}
\label{hmm_synthesis}
Statistical parametric speech synthesis has grown in the last decade thanks to the advantages commented in Section \ref{hmm_based_speech_synthesis}: adaptability and memory requirements. In this section HMM-Based Speech Synthesis is explained.

\subsection{Hidden Markov Models}
\label{hmm_syntheis_markov}
As the name suggests, HMM-Based systems are assumed to be a Markov process with unobserved states.
