	Play the reference sentence. Then play both sample sentences. Considering the OVERALL QUALITY of the signal, select the one you would prefer to represent the reference voice in applications like mobile devices, video games, audio books etc. Regarding the OVERALL QUALITY
	\begin{itemize}
	\item[A.] First sample is better
	\item[B.] Second sample is better
	\item[C.] They sound exactly the same
