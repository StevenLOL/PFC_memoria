In this project we study the effects of noise on a speaker-adaptive HMM-based synthetic system based on the GlottHMM vocoder.
%
The average voice model is trained with clean data, but it is adapted to the target speaker using speech samples that have been corrupted by artificially adding background noise to simulate low quality recordings. 
%
The synthesized speech played without background noise should not compromise the intelligibility or naturalness.

A comparison is made to system based on the STRAIGHT vocoder when the background noise is babble noise.
%
Both objective and subjective evaluation methods were conducted.
%
GlottHMM is found to be less robust against severe noise.
%
When the noise is less intrusive, the used objective measures gave contradictory results and no preference to either vocoder was shown in the listening tests.
%
In the preference of moderate noise levels, GlottHMM performs as well as the STRAIGHT vocoder.
