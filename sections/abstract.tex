In this project we study the effects of noise on a speaker-adaptive HMM-based synthetic system based on the GlottHMM vocoder.
%
A comparison is made to system based on the STRAIGHT vocoder when the background noise is babble noise.
%
Both objective and subjective evaluation methods were conducted.
%
GlottHMM is found to be less robust against severe noise.
%
When the noise is less intrusive, the used objective measures gave contradictory results and no preference to either vocoder was shown in the listening tests.
%
In the preference of moderate noise levels, GlottHMM performs as well as the STRAIGHT vocoder.
