Back in those days, the brazen heads were said to be owned by wizards. Following Pope Sylvester II, some important characters in mankind history  were reputed to have one of these heads, such as Albertus Magnus or Roger Bacon.

During the 18th century, Christian Kratzenstein, a German-born doctor, physicist and engineer working at the Russian Academy of Sciences, was able to built acoustics resonators similar to the human vocal tract. He activated the resonators with vibrating reeds producing the the five long vowels: /a/, /e/, /i/, /o/ and /u/.

Almost at the end of the 18th century, in 1791, Wolfgang von Kempelen presented his Acoustic-Mechanical Speech Machine \cite{vonKempelen},
