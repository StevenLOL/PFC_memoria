Speech synthesis is not a recent ambition in mankind history. The earliest attempts to synthesize speech are only legends starring Gerbert d'Aurillac (died 1003 A.D.), also known as Pope Sylvester II. The pretended system used by him was a brazen head: a legendary automaton imitating the anatomy of a human head and capable to answer any question. Back in those days, the brazen heads were said to be owned by wizards. Following Pope Sylvester II, some important characters in mankind history  were reputed to have one of these heads, such as Albertus Magnus or Roger Bacon.

During the 18th century, Christian Kratzenstein, a German-born doctor, physicist and engineer working at the Russian Academy of Sciences, was able to built acoustics resonators similar to the human vocal tract. He activated the resonators with vibrating reeds producing the the five long vowels: /a/, /e/, /i/, /o/ and /u/.

Almost at the end of the 18th century, in 1791, Wolfgang von Kempelen presented his Acoustic-Mechanical Speech Machine \cite{vonKempelen}, which was able to produce single sounds and some combinations. During the first half of the 19th century, Charles Wheatstone built his improved and more complicated version of Kempelen's Acoustic-Mechanical Speech Machine, capable of producing vowels, almost all the consonants, sound combinations and even some words.	

In the late 1800's, Alexander Graham Bell also built a speaking machine and did some questionable experiments changing with his hands the vocal tract of his dog and making the dog bark in order to produce speech-like sounds \cite{Schroeder93}.
